            You are replicating the Claude Code `/init` command. Analyse this codebase comprehensively and create
            an AGENTS.md file containing essential project information for agentic coding agents.

            ## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

            **1. CODEBASE DISCOVERY:**
            - Scan the entire repository structure using available tools (EXCLUDE .github folder - it has separate workflows)
            - Identify the primary programming language(s) and frameworks
            - Detect package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, pip, cargo, go mod, etc.)
            - Find configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, etc.)
            - Locate build tools and task runners
            - Identify testing frameworks and test directories
            - Discover documentation patterns and README files
            - Check for existing development guidelines (.cursorrules, .cursorignore, etc.)

            **2. DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW ANALYSIS:**
            - Extract build commands from package.json scripts, Makefile, or other build files
            - Identify test commands (unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests)
            - Find linting and formatting commands (eslint, prettier, black, rustfmt, etc.)
            - Discover typecheck commands (tsc, mypy, etc.)
            - Locate deployment or start/serve commands
            - Identify dependency management commands

            **3. CODE STYLE AND CONVENTIONS:**
            - Analyze existing code to determine:
              - Indentation style (tabs vs spaces, 2 vs 4 spaces)
              - Naming conventions (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase)
              - Import organization patterns
              - File organization structure
              - Comment and documentation styles
              - Error handling patterns
              - Preferred libraries and frameworks

            **4. PROJECT CONTEXT:**
            - Determine project type (web app, API, library, CLI tool, mobile app, etc.)
            - Identify key technologies and their versions
            - Understand the project's architecture and main components
            - Note any special development requirements or constraints

            ## OUTPUT FORMAT:

            Create an AGENTS.md file that follows this structure (approximately 20-30 lines):

            ```markdown
            # [Project Name] - Development Guide

            ## Project Overview
            [Brief description of what this project is and its main purpose]

            ## Technology Stack
            - **Language**: [Primary language and version]
            - **Framework**: [Main framework if applicable]
            - **Package Manager**: [npm/yarn/pnpm/pip/cargo/etc.]
            - **[Other key technologies]**: [versions/details]

            ## Development Commands
            ```bash
            # Build
            [build command]

            # Test
            [test command]
            [single test command if different]

            # Lint
            [lint command]

            # Format
            [format command]

            # Type Check
            [typecheck command if applicable]

            # Start/Serve
            [dev server command]

            # Install Dependencies
            [install command]
            ```

            ## Code Style Guidelines
            - **Indentation**: [tabs/2 spaces/4 spaces]
            - **Naming**: [camelCase/snake_case/PascalCase for different contexts]
            - **Imports**: [organization style, absolute vs relative paths]
            - **Comments**: [preferred comment style and when to use them]
            - **Error Handling**: [preferred error handling patterns]
            - **[Language-specific conventions]**: [any specific style rules]

            ## Project Structure
            - `[key directory]`: [purpose]
            - `[key file]`: [purpose]
            [Other important structural notes]

            ## Development Notes
            - [Any special setup requirements]
            - [Important development considerations]
            - [Common gotchas or important patterns to follow]

            ## Additional Instructions
            - see @README.md for more information specific to this project
            - see @.claude/mothership-instructions.md for global instructions required to be followed
            ```

            ## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

            1. **Use ALL available tools** to thoroughly analyze the codebase
            2. **Actually inspect files** - don't make assumptions about commands or structure
            3. **Extract real commands** from actual config files (package.json, Makefile, etc.)
            4. **Observe actual code patterns** to determine style guidelines
            5. **Keep it concise but comprehensive** - focus on actionable information
            6. **If AGENTS.md already exists**, analyze it and improve/update it rather than replacing it
            7. **Make it team-friendly** - this file should help any developer understand the project quickly
            8. **Focus on commands agents will need** - prioritize build, test, lint, and format commands
            9. **Include single test commands** if they differ from running all tests
            10. **Add version constraints** where they matter for compatibility
            11. **Skip .github folder analysis** - it has separate workflow-specific documentation

            ## ANALYSIS APPROACH:

            Start by using BatchTool or multiple tool calls to:
            1. Get overall project structure with GlobTool (exclude .github folder)
            2. Read key configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
            3. Examine a few representative source files for style patterns
            4. Check for existing documentation or style guides
            5. Look for CI/CD configurations that might reveal commands (outside .github)
            6. Synthesize findings into the AGENTS.md format

            Remember: This file will be used by AI coding agents (including Claude Code, Cursor, and others) to understand your project.
            Make it accurate, actionable, and comprehensive enough to guide effective development assistance.
